# Experimenting with Svelte and Svelte Kit

This repository includes my experimental code as I work through some beginner's exploration of the [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) front-end framework, and it's partner application framework [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs).
The accompanying notes can be found [here]();
